            Objective of the project: “The ImageNet for the blind.”
		
The aim is building, annotating and create a dataset that could be known as the “ImageNet” for the blind, i.e., a dataset of images taken from a wearable camera worn by blind people (or with their phones), that can later facilitate image captioning and question answering to help them be more independent in their daily lives.
